# Current state

- Discovery/parsing of own code working
- Copying of code via blocks not working
  - Differences in instruction count of copied code
  - Needs to check fixing of block endings, maybe the problem is there
- Fixing of relative call targets not implemented, so calls currently will get messed up after copying
